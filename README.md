### Structure of the repo: 

* **report.pdf** - description of the tasks, feature engeneering process, description of suggested solution and comparison of different classifiaction algorithms

* **sfcrime_data_preparation.ipynb** - reading, vizualization, feature extraction and saving to .h5 file

* **different_classifiers.ipynb** - Logistic Regression, Random Forests, XgBoost, KNN and it's comparison. Parameters for RF, XGB and KNN are selected after experementations 

* folder **model/**  - list of NN models which were invlolved to experementations.

* The file with intermediate results of the experiments on different algorithms and Neural Net parameters: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qeAQOeDu3sI8lirf49QD7eeigWs_MNZbDhA1oXElQ94/edit?usp=sharing
